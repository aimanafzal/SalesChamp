Postman collection can be accessed throug the link give below or a copy of collection is available on the root:

Link to Heroku to get started with APIs call, the mlab for cloud mongodb is already configured.

Mlab for mongoDB is already connected within the source to get started with calling the APIs on the go. But if you want to configure a local database, the instructions are provided below.

Either you can utilize it by Docker or Kubernetes.

Instructions and code to deploy MongoDB, a backend Node.js microservice that connects to it.

The backend uses Express and features a `/api/address` endpoint with CRUD operations enabled.
Run the test script by using npm test


MongoDB is deployed with persistence and replicas: this is where items are stored.

Tested using the Kubernetes service provided by [Docker for Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/).

## Quickstart for local development
- Deploy MongoDB as a Docker container or on Kubernetes first
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Quickstart for Docker
- `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile  -t backend:v1.0.0 backend`
- `docker pull mongo`
- `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mern-mongo mongo `
- `export MONGO_URL=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mern-mongo)`
- `docker run -p 30555:30555 -e MONGO_URL=$MONGO_URL backend:v1.0.0`


## Quickstart for Kubernetes
Requires building the images first, see the quickstart for Docker section.

- Set your Kubernetes context so you're pointing to a Kubernetes environment.
- `helm install --name mongo --set usePassword=false,replicaSet.enabled=true,service.type=LoadBalancer,replicaSet.replicas.secondary=3 stable/mongodb`
- `helm install --name backend backend/chart/backend`



### Docker

Install Docker on your Mac.

```
docker build -t backend:v1.0.0 .
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mern-mongo mongo
export MONGO_URL=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mern-mongo)
docker run -p 30555:30555 -e MONGO_URL=$MONGO_URL backend:v1.0.0
```

### Kubernetes

Use the Docker system tray (click the whale in the top right corner) then go to Preferences -> Advanced -> Enable Kubernetes, choose Kubernetes as the orchestrator and to show system containers. Apply and restart Docker, waiting for Kubernetes to be reported as available.

Check `values.yaml` points to the image you've built, e.g. `backend:v1.0.0`.

Deploy MongoDB into your cluster with `helm install --name mongo --set usePassword=false,replicaSet.enabled=true,service.type=LoadBalancer,replicaSet.replicas.secondary=3 stable/mongodb`

MongoDB has a variety of [configuration options](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb) you can provide with `--set`.

Deploy this Node.js application into your cluster with  `helm install --name backend chart/mernexample`. 

This Node.js application connects to the MongoDB service and will retry on connection loss (so the MongoDB pod can be killed).

Data from MongoDB is persisted at `$HOME/.docker/Volumes/mongo-mongodb`.

Tested on Mac with Kubernetes (docker-for-desktop).

### Deploying the backend
`helm install --name backend chart/backend`

### Using Postman

Assuming you've deployed to Kubernetes (notice the bigger port number here: this is the specified NodePort which will be used when you Helm install its chart):




Data is stored in MongoDB (both in the container and in the persistent volume on your local disk).


### Like to script things too?
`./script.sh x` where x is how many records you would like to create. A POST request is sent to the to create x amount of records by sending POST requests to the `api/address endpoint`.


### Like dashboards?
- Visit `localhost:30555/appmetrics-dash` in your web browser to view request, CPU, memory and call stack information automatically gathered for you

### How about Prometheus?
- `helm install --name prometheus stable/prometheus --set server.service.type=NodePort`

You can view the Prometheus dashboard at the NodePort Prometheus uses: hint, do `kubectl get svc | grep exposed-prometheus`: it is the larger port you see that should be used.

This works because in our Node.js application, `service.yaml` has the following defined:

```
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
```

The `appmetrics-prometheus` module sends data to the `/metrics` endpoint, which is scraped by Prometheus automatically: you can view the collected metrics at `localhost:30555/metrics`.
